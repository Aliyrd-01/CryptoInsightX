# Crypto Analyzer

## Overview

Crypto Analyzer is a web application providing professional trading tools for cryptocurrency markets. The platform features two main products: a Trading Analyzer for real-time indicator analysis and smart trade recommendations, and an Arbitrage Tool for identifying price differences across multiple exchanges. The application uses a modern dark-themed interface with 3D visual elements and is built as a single-page application with user authentication.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack**
- React 18+ with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- Vite as the build tool and development server
- Wouter for lightweight client-side routing (replacing React Router)
- TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and data fetching
- Shadcn UI component library built on Radix UI primitives

**Design System**
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with custom configuration
- Dark mode as the default theme with light mode support
- Custom color palette using HSL values with CSS variables for theming
- Component variants using class-variance-authority (CVA)
- Typography: Inter/Poppins for UI, JetBrains Mono for code/numbers
- Spacing based on Tailwind's 4px unit system

**State Management Strategy**
- React Context API for authentication state (AuthProvider)
- TanStack Query for all server state and API data
- Local component state with React hooks for UI-only state
- Session-based authentication stored in HTTP-only cookies

**Component Architecture**
- Page components in `client/src/pages/` (Home, Auth, Dashboard, NotFound)
- Reusable section components for landing page (Header, Hero, Features, CTA, Footer)
- UI primitives in `client/src/components/ui/` following Shadcn patterns
- Path aliases configured: `@/` for client src, `@shared/` for shared code, `@assets/` for assets

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework**
- Express.js as the web server framework
- TypeScript with ESM modules for type safety and modern JavaScript
- Session-based authentication using express-session
- Custom middleware for request logging and JSON parsing

**API Design Pattern**
- RESTful API endpoints under `/api` prefix
- Authentication endpoints: `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/logout`, `/api/auth/me`
- JSON request/response format with Zod schema validation
- Error responses include descriptive messages in JSON format

**Data Storage**
- Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL with schema in `shared/schema.ts`
- In-memory storage fallback (MemStorage) for development without database
- User model with id, email, password (hashed), name, and createdAt fields
- Database migrations in `migrations/` directory managed by Drizzle Kit

**Authentication & Security**
- Bcrypt for password hashing (10 rounds)
- Express-session with configurable secret (environment variable)
- HTTP-only cookies for session storage
- Session middleware protecting authenticated routes
- CSRF protection through same-site cookie policy

**Development vs Production**
- Vite middleware integration in development for HMR
- Static file serving in production from `dist/public`
- Environment-based configuration (NODE_ENV)
- Separate build scripts for client and server bundles

### Build & Deployment

**Build Process**
- Client: Vite builds to `dist/public` with code splitting and optimization
- Server: esbuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js` as ESM module
- TypeScript compilation checking without emit (tsc --noEmit)
- Combined build script chains both client and server builds

**Development Workflow**
- `npm run dev` starts Express server with Vite middleware for HMR
- Hot module replacement for client-side changes
- Server restart required for backend changes (using tsx for TypeScript execution)
- Type checking available via `npm run check`

### Database Schema

**Users Table**
- Primary key: UUID generated by PostgreSQL
- Email field with unique constraint
- Hashed password storage
- Optional name field
- Created timestamp with default value
- Zod schemas for validation (insertUserSchema, loginSchema)

## External Dependencies

**UI Component Libraries**
- Radix UI primitives for accessible, unstyled components (accordion, dialog, dropdown, etc.)
- Shadcn UI configuration for styled components built on Radix
- Lucide React for icon components
- React Hook Form with Zod resolvers for form validation

**Database & ORM**
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database queries
- @neondatabase/serverless for PostgreSQL connection (configured for Neon)
- Drizzle Kit for schema migrations and database management
- PostgreSQL as the production database

**Authentication & Session**
- express-session for session management
- connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session store (when database available)
- bcrypt for password hashing
- Cookie-based session storage with configurable security

**State Management & Data Fetching**
- @tanstack/react-query for server state caching and synchronization
- Custom fetch wrapper functions in `lib/queryClient.ts`
- Automatic retry and refetch configuration
- Query invalidation on mutations

**Development Tools**
- Vite with React plugin for fast development
- @replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal for error overlay
- @replit/vite-plugin-cartographer and dev-banner for Replit integration
- PostCSS with Tailwind and Autoprefixer

**Styling & Theming**
- Tailwind CSS v3+ with custom theme extension
- class-variance-authority for component variants
- clsx and tailwind-merge (via cn utility) for conditional classes
- CSS variables for theme colors supporting light/dark modes

**Asset Management**
- Generated images stored in `attached_assets/generated_images/`
- Image imports via Vite with `@assets/` alias
- PNG format for 3D character illustrations and coin decorative elements
